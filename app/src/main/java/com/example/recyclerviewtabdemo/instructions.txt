//copy all images to the drawables folder
//we are gonna create a tab based navigation, and a recycler view on the bottom.

//the main package will have models and adapters.
//Models has the data, which can be live data or db sources
//adapter, is a viewgroup, contains the data, logic for arranging

//order is as follow
//on activity, we setContentView with a RecyclerView, which has a setAdpater,
//that has an adapter object that houses data. helps inflate it and populating to an external layout
//that external layout is an xml layout resource, that can be composed of fragments


//lets tart
//add tablayout to the activiyt_main
//edit the id of the tab items
//add the recyclerview and constraint it

//let's add a class for containing the data, in the case, Tune class
//add their variables, and then generate getters and setter, after generate a constructor

//now on main activity, lets get the data, we could get from a db or wherever, but in this case
//we are gonna create a list from where we get the data.
//basically all the lists at the beginning of our main activity

//now lets create a method that loads all the data, and from there we call it on the onCreate and log to confirm

//for the view or fragment we create a new layout
//create a new layout XML file, (layout folder right click, new>xml>layout xml file) not a resource!!, on the layout folder, layout_tune
//change it to a constraintlayout, layout width and height, to wrap content
//add for the image, and text, make it look nice, add gravity to text, constraints, etc.

now we just need the adpater, so we connect our recyclerview to the data, and maybe later do the tabbing action.
//create a new java class on main app, TuneAdapter and then extend RecyclerView.adapter
//do not automatically import methods or override, instead create your own custom adpater.
//follow all the instruction within the adapter file.

//go back to the main activity, and on the on create continue creating the REcyclerView. step 11..

//to set click listeners, continue on the tune adapter, inside the onCreateViewHolder we can set
//the listener in the whole thing or per item inside. step 12.

//create the tab listener on the main activity, step 13...
